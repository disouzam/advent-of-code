# About 

The idea of this repository is to collect my own work and ideas to solve Advent of Code challenges. Whenever I take an idea from others, I will explicitly mention and include links to the source. The work here might be developed in different languages including C#, Python, Javascript and others as it makes sense for learning / experimentation.
